\section{System Design}
Recalling related works in Chapter 2, what motivates the design of Cardea are the follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item People's privacy concerns are dependent on context. Although in certain circumstances locations are strong hints of possible privacy intrusion, generally what individuals are doing and with whom are more essential and crucial factors that directly relate to privacy.
\item People's privacy preferences vary from each other, thus they should be able to express their personal privacy preferences.
\item People's privacy preferences may change from time to time, therefore they need a way to change such preferences easily.
\end{itemize}

To achieve these objectives, we propose following solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item explain what composes context in Cardea
\item registration of privacy preferences
\item hand gesture for flexibility
\end{itemize}
